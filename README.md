👋 Hi there

I'm Ronan Lino, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast.
With over 6 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.


🚀 Expertise

Passionate about solving hard and complex problems, developing new solutions, refactoring and optimizing performance. I'm worked as a full stack developer, but I always had a preference and an easier time handling things from backend.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Back-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier APIs, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

Outside of the professional environment, I'm frequently reading articles, watching videos and news about new techs, some good manors in coding and new Design patterns.
